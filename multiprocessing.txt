threads share address space.
processes share files,queues, message pipelines but not address space.

memory leak effects threads not processes

p1=multiprocessing.process()
p1.start

lock.acquire()
lock.release()

pools - map() to multiple processors and reduce the results with join()


sharing data between processes with queues:
queue is shared memory -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp7EhjLkFY4

q=multiprocesing.Queue()
p=multiprocessing.process(target=function, args=(function agrs,q))

if queue is empty then q.get()

special varible: __name__  is sent to main when a program starts
'main' is the name of the program that calls all other modules.
checks if file is being run directly or is it being imported.

underscores in python:
singel _ means - hint that name should be treated as private - not mandated by python interpreter but programmers use it for KT.

double underscore (dunder) __baz - creates a vairiable with classname followed by dunder .. _classname_baz.. this wil help with naming colision between classes
